# Overview

For this final project, we examined the public available data from Boston Police Department (BPD). We are going to focus on two main goals: 1) Understanding the geographical and temporal crime pattern in Boston, as well as evaluating if the crime categories are related with certain situational or environmental factors 2) Forecasting the types of criminal misconduct in Boston at night, with the ultimate goal to help the Police Department with a model that offers insightful information to better control the crime rate.

# Motivation

Based on FBI crime data, in 2018, Boston ranked 14 out of 50 in the US with regard to crime rate. The chance of being a victim of either violent or property crime in Boston is as high as 1 in 34, which makes Boston more violent than cities such as New York and Seattle. Even though Boston crime statistics demonstrate an overall downward trend in violent and property crimes in the past years, the cityâ€™s crime rate is still a lot higher than the national average crime rate. 
Considering that the Boston Police Department has limited resources to foot patrol and guard a wide range of areas at night. Under this circumstance, distributing the limited intervention capacity to the most needed location is of great importance. If we are able to use data analytics to forecast the types of crime misconduct of each district at a certain time, the Boston Police will have better visibility on allocate manpower with targeted preparation. For this project we are also interested to see if certain situational and environmental features are linked with crime types. Understanding this context in which violence occurs has broad applicability to public policies on violence mitigation. The project result will hopefully help BPD to design a more effective intervention program to reduce the crime rate at night.

# Methods

We used _Crime Incident Report_ from the Boston Police Department, US Census, and Massachusetts State Alcohol Beverage Control Commission. Spatial modeling was employed at the block group level, and violent crime, alcohol outlets, and drug markets were mapped.
